    * Chooses one of three ways in which receipt of the signal number sig is to
    * be subsequently handled. If the value of func is SIG_DFL, default
    * handling for that signal will occur. If the value of func is SIG_IGN, the
    * signal will be ignored. Otherwise func shall point to a function to be
    * called when that signal occurs.
    * When a signal occurs, if func points to a function, first the equivalent
    * of signal(sig, SIG_DFL); is executed. (If the value of sig is SIGILL,
    * whether the reset to SIG_DFL occurs is implementation-defined (under
    * RISCOS/Arthur/Brazil the reset does occur)). Next the equivalent of
    * (*func)(sig); is executed. The function may terminate by calling the
    * abort, exit or longjmp function. If func executes a return statement and
    * the value of sig was SIGFPE or any other implementation-defined value
    * corresponding to a computational exception, the behaviour is undefined.
    * Otherwise, the program will resume execution at the point it was
    * interrupted.
    * If the signal occurs other than as a result of calling the abort or raise
    * function, the behaviour is undefined if the signal handler calls any
    * function in the standard library other than the signal function itself
    * or refers to any object with static storage duration other than by
    * assigning a value to a volatile static variable of type sig_atomic_t.
    * At program startup, the equivalent of signal(sig, SIG_IGN); may be
    * executed for some signals selected in an implementation-defined manner
    * (under RISCOS/Arthur/Brazil this does not occur); the equivalent of
    * signal(sig, SIG_DFL); is executed for all other signals defined by the
    * implementation.
    * Returns: If the request can be honoured, the signal function returns the
    *          value of func for most recent call to signal for the specified
    *          signal sig. Otherwise, a value of SIG_ERR is returned and the
    *          integer expression errno is set to indicate the error.
