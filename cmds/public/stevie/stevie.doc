       STEVIE is an editor designed to mimic the interface  of  the
       UNIX  editor  'vi'.  The name (ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts)
       comes from the fact that the editor was  first  written  for
       the  Atari ST. The current version also supports UNIX, Minix
       (ST), MS-DOS, and OS/2, but I've left the  name  intact  for
       now.

       This program is the result of many late  nights  of  hacking
       over  the  last  couple  of  years.   The  first version was
       written by Tim Thompson and posted to USENET. From there,  I
       reworked  the  data  structures  completely,  added  LOTS of
       features, and generally improved the overall performance  in
       the process.

       I've labelled STEVIE an 'aspiring' vi clone as a warning  to
       those  who  may expect too much. On the whole, the editor is
       pretty complete.  Nearly all of the visual mode commands are
       supported.   And several of the more important 'ex' commands
       are supported as well.  I've tried hard to capture the  feel
       of vi by getting the little things right.  Making lines wrap
       correctly, supporting true operators, and even  getting  the
       cursor  to  land on the right place for tabs are all a pain,
       but really help make the editor feel right.  I've  tried  to
       resist  the  temptation  to deviate from the behavior of vi,
       even where I disagree with the original design.

       The biggest problem remaining has to do with the  fact  that
       the  edit  buffer is maintained entirely in memory, limiting
       the size of files that can be edited in  some  environments.
       Other  missing  features  include  named buffers and macros.
       Performance is generally  reasonable,  although  the  screen
       update code could be more efficient.  This is generally only
       visible on fairly slow systems.

       STEVIE  may  be  freely  distributed.   The   source   isn't
       copyrighted  or  restricted  in  any  way.  If  you pass the
       program along, please include all the documentation and,  if
       practical, the source as well. I'm not fanatical about this,
       but I tried to make STEVIE fairly portable and I'd  like  to
       see as many people have access to the source as possible.

       The remainder of this document describes  the  operation  of
       the  editor.   This  is  intended  as  a reference for users
       already familiar with the real vi editor.

       The following command line forms are supported:

       stevie [file ...]   Edit the specified file(s)

       stevie -t tag       Start at the location of the given tag

       stevie + file       Edit file starting at end

       stevie +n file      Edit file starting a line number 'n'

       stevie +/pat file   Edit file starting at pattern 'pat'

       If multiple files are given on the command line  (using  the
       first  form),  the  ":n" command goes to the next file, ":N"
       goes backward in the list, and ":rew" can be used to  rewind
       back to the start of the file list.

       The ":set" command works as usual to  set  parameters.  Each
       parameter  has  a  long  and  an abbreviated name, either of
       which may be used. Boolean parameters are set as in:

            set showmatch

       or cleared by:

            set noshowmatch

       Numeric parameters are set as in:

            set scroll=5

       Several parameters may be set with a single command:

            set novb sm report=1

       To see the status of all parameters use ":set  all".  Typing
       ":set"  with  no  arguments  will show only those parameters
       that have been changed.   The  supported  parameters,  their
       names,  abbreviations,  defaults, and descriptions are shown
       below:

       autoindent  Short: ai, Default: noai, Type: Boolean
                   When in insert mode, start new lines at the same
                   column  as  the  prior  line. Unlike vi, you can
                   backspace over the indentation.

       backup      Short: bk, Default: nobk, Type: Boolean
                   Leave a backup on  file  writes.   (During  file
                   writes,  a  backup  is  always  kept  for safety
                   anyway, until the write is completed.   At  that
                   point, the 'backup' parameter determines whether
                   the backup file is deleted.)

       color       Short:  co,  Default:  system-dependent,   Type:
                   Numeric
                   Change  the  screen  color  (video  attributes).
                   There  is  a  system-dependent  mapping  between
                   numbers and colors.  (For instance, in MSDOS  we
                   use   the   BIOS-type   attributes  for  CGA  or
                   monochrome screens in alphanumeric mode.)

       errorbells  Short: eb, Default: noeb, Type: Boolean
                   Ring bell when error messages are shown.

       ignorecase  Short: ic, Default: noic, Type: Boolean
                   Ignore case in string searches.

       lines       Short: lines, Default: lines=25, Type: Numeric
                   Number of physical  lines  on  the  screen.  The
                   default  value  and  possible settings depend on
                   the host machine.  The default value  is  25  on
                   most systems.

       list        Short: list, Default: nolist, Type: Boolean
                   Show tabs and newlines graphically.

       modelines   Short: ml, Default: noml, Type: Boolean
                   Enable processing of modelines in files.

       number      Short: nu, Default: nonu, Type: Boolean
                   Display lines on  the  screen  with  their  line
                   numbers.

       report      Short: report, Default: report=5, Type: Numeric
                   Minimum number of lines to report operations on.

       return      Short: cr, Default: cr, Type: Boolean
                   End lines with cr-lf when writing files.

       scroll      Short: scroll, Default: scroll=12, Type: Numeric
                   Number of lines to scroll for ^D & ^U.

       showmatch   Short: sm, Default: nosm, Type: Boolean
                   When a ), }, or ] is typed, show the matching (,
                   {,  or [ if it's on the current screen by moving
                   the cursor there briefly.

       showmode    Short: mo, Default: nomo, Type: Boolean
                   Show on status line when in insert mode.

       tabstop     Short: ts, Default: ts=8, Type: Numeric
                   Number of spaces in a tab.

       tagstack    Short: tg, Default: notg, Type: Boolean
                   If set, the tag command :ta is  "stacked";  that
                   is, the place from which it was called is pushed
                   onto a stack.  A new command ":untag" goes  back
                   to that place, and pops the tag stack.

       terse       Short: terse, Default: noterse, Type: Boolean
                   This  option  is  currently  ignored.    It   is
                   provided only for compatibility with vi.

       tildeop     Short: to, Default: noto, Type: Boolean
                   If set, tilde is an operator.  Otherwise,  tilde
                   acts as normal.

       wrapscan    Short: ws, Default: ws, Type: Boolean
                   String searches wrap  around  the  ends  of  the
                   file.

       vbell       Short: vb, Default: vb, Type: Boolean
                   Use  a  visual  bell,  if  possible.  (novb  for
                   audible bell)

       The EXINIT environment variable can be used  to  modify  the
       default values on startup as in:

            setenv EXINIT="set sm ts=4"

       In environments (e.g. OS/2 or TOS) where lines are  normally
       terminated  by CR-LF, the 'return' parameter allows files to
       be written with only a LF terminator (if  the  parameter  is
       cleared).  This parameter is ignored on UNIX systems.

       The 'lines' parameter tells the editor how many lines  there
       are  on  the  screen.  This is useful on systems like the ST
       (or OS/2 machines with an EGA adapter) where various  screen
       resolutions  may  be  used.  By using the 'lines' parameter,
       different screen sizes can be easily handled.

       Several of the normal 'vi' colon commands are  supported  by
       STEVIE.   Some  commands  may  be  preceded  by a line range
       specification.  For commands that accept a range  of  lines,
       the following address forms are supported:



                                  - 4 -







       STEVIE                                        User Reference



            addr
            addr + number
            addr - number

       where 'addr' may be one of the following:

            a line number
            a mark (as in 'a or 'b)
            '.' (the current line)
            '$' (the last line)

       An address range of "%" is accepted as  an  abbreviation  of
       "1,$".

       Mode lines are a little-known, but often useful, feature  of
       vi.   To use this feature, special strings are placed in the
       first or last five lines  in  a  file.   When  the  file  is
       edited,  these  strings are detected and processed as though
       typed as a colon command.  One instance where  this  can  be
       useful  is  to  set  the  "tabstop"  parameter on a per-file
       basis.  The following are examples of mode lines:

            vi:set ts=4 noai:
            ex:45:

       Mode lines are characterized by  the  string  "vi"  or  "ex"
       followed  by  a command surrounded by colons. Other text may
       appear on the line, and multiple mode lines may be  present.
       No  guarantee  is made regarding the order in which multiple
       mode lines will be processed.

       The processing of mode lines is enabled by setting the  "ml"
       parameter.  This  should be done in the "EXINIT" environment
       variable, so that mode line processing is enabled as soon as
       the  editor begins.  By default, mode lines are disabled for
       security reasons.

       A limited form of the global command is supported, accepting
       the following command form:

            g/pattern/X

       where X may be either 'd' or 'p' to delete  or  print  lines
       that  match  the  given  pattern.  If a line range is given,
       only those lines are checked for a match with  the  pattern.
       If no range is given, all lines are checked.

       If  the  trailing  command  character  is  omitted,  'p'  is
       assumed.  In this case, the trailing slash is also optional.
       The current version of the editor does not support the  undo
       operation  following  the  deletion of lines with the global
       command.

       4.3  TTTThhhheeee SSSSuuuubbbbssssttttiiiittttuuuutttteeee CCCCoooommmmmmmmaaaannnndddd

       The substitute command provides  a  powerful  mechanism  for
       making  more complex substitutions than can be done directly
       from visual mode.  The general form of the command is:

            s/pattern/replacement/g

       Each line in the given range (or the  current  line,  if  no
       range   was   given)   is  scanned  for  the  given  regular
       expression.  When found, the string that matched the pattern
       is  replaced  with  the  given  replacement  string.  If the
       replacement string is null, each matching pattern string  is
       deleted.

       The trailing 'g' is optional and, if present, indicates that
       multiple  occurrences  of  'pattern' on a line should all be
       replaced.

       Some special sequences are  recognized  in  the  replacement
       string.  The  ampersand  character is replaced by the entire
       pattern  that  was  matched.   For  example,  the  following
       command  could  be  used  to put all occurrences of 'foo' or
       'bar' within double quotes:

            1,$s/foo|bar/"&"/g

       The special sequence "\n" where 'n' is a digit from 1 to  9,
       is  replaced  by  the  string  the matched the corresponding
       parenthesized  expression  in  the  pattern.  The  following
       command  could  be  used to swap the first two parameters in
       calls to the C function "foo":

            1,$s/foo\(([^,]*),([^,]*),/foo(\2,\1,/g

       Like the global command, substitutions can't be undone  with
       this version of the editor.

       The following table shows the  supported  file  manipulation
       commands  as  well  as  some other 'ex' commands that aren't

       :sh             run an interactive shell
       :!cmd           run a command

       The commands above work pretty much like they  do  in  'vi'.
       Most  of  the commands support a '!' suffix (if appropriate)
       to discard any pending changes.

       The ":help" command can also be invoked with the <HELP>  key
       on  the Atari ST and the F1 key on MSDOS and OS/2 PCs.  This
       actually displays a pretty complete summary of the  real  vi
       with  unsupported features indicated appropriately.  Certain
       features controlled by "set"  parameters  will  have  varied
       displays  on  the Help screens, to correspond to the current
       setting of their parameters.

       The  help  screens  (there  are  multiple  screens)  can  be
       traversed  using "reasonable" keystrokes.  For instance, any
       key that would take you "down" in the vi editor,  will  take
       you   to   the  next  help  screen  in  the  help  facility.
       Similarly, "up" commands  will  take  you  to  the  previous

       screen.  The  screens are numbered, and any numeric key will
       take you to the  corresponding  screen.   The  first  screen
       (screen 0) is a table of contents for the help screens.

       String searches are supported, as in vi, accepting the usual
       regular  expression  syntax.  This was done using a modified
       form of Henry Spencer's regular expression library. I  added
       code  outside  the  library  to  support  the  '\<' and '\>'
       extensions.  The parameter "ignorecase" can be set to ignore
       case in all string searches.

       The vi operators (d, c,  y,  !,  <,  and  >)  work  as  true
       operators.   The  tilde  command  may  also  be  used  as an
       operator  if  the  parameter  "tildeop"  has  been  set.  By

       Tags are implemented and a fairly simple version of  'ctags'
       is  supplied  with  the editor. The current version of ctags
       will find functions and macros  following  a  specific  (but
       common) form.  See 'ctags.doc' for a complete discussion.

       A non-standard but useful variant of tags is the  "stacking"
       of calls to the ':ta' command.  When tag-stacking is enabled
       (with ':set tg'), stevie remembers (and stacks) the position
       from  which  any  tag  call  is  made.   In this mode, a new
       ':untag' command returns to the remembered position and pops
       the  stack.   Also  while  in  the tagstack mode, the Ctrl-^
       keystroke  has  a  somewhat  different  effect.   Before  it
       switches  to  edit the alternate file (its normal function),
       it checks to see if the tag stack  is  empty,  and  does  an
       ':untag' if not empty.

       9.1  AAAAttttaaaarrrriiii SSSSTTTT

       9.1.1  _T_O_S   The  editor  has  been  tested  in  all   three
       resolutions, although low and high res. are less tested than
       medium. The 50-line high res. mode can be  used  by  setting
       the  'lines' parameter to 50. Alternatively, the environment
       variable 'LINES' can be set. The editor doesn't actively set
       the  number  of  lines on the screen. It just operates using
       the number of lines it was told.

       The arrow keys, as well as the <INSERT>, <HELP>, and  <UNDO>
       keys are all mapped appropriately.

       9.1.2  _M_i_n_i_x  The editor  is  pretty  much  the  same  under
       Minix,   but  many  of  the  keyboard  mappings  aren't  yet
       supported.

       9.2  UUUUNNNNIIIIXXXX

       The editor has been ported to UNIX System  V  release  3  as
       well as 4.2 BSD.  This was done mainly to get some profiling
       data so I haven't  put  much  effort  into  doing  the  UNIX
       version  right.   While  the termcap routines are supported,
       the editor is still fairly picky about the  capabilities  it
       wants  and makes little effort to do clever things with less
       intelligent terminals.

       9.3  OOOOSSSS////2222

       This port was done because the editor that  comes  with  the
       OS/2 developer's kit really stinks. Make sure 'ansi' mode is
       on (using the 'ansi'  command).   The  OS/2  console  driver
       doesn't  support  insert/delete line, so STEVIE bypasses the
       driver and makes  the  appropriate  system  calls  directly.
       This  is  all done in the system-specific part of the editor
       so the kludge is at least localized.

       The arrow keys, page up/down and home/end all do what  you'd
       expect.  The  function  keys  are  hard-coded to some useful
       macros until I can get true  support  for  macros  into  the
       editor. The current mappings are:

       9.4  MMMMSSSSDDDDOOOOSSSS

       STEVIE has been ported to MSDOS 3.3 using (1) the  Microsoft
       C  compiler,  version  5.1,  and  (2)  the  Borland  Turbo C
       compiler, version 2.0.

       The keyboard mappings are the same as for  OS/2.   The  only
       problem  with the PC version is that the inefficiency of the
       screen update code  becomes  painfully  apparent  on  slower
       machines.   (In  Rev  3.69a,  there  are a couple of ways in
       which screen I/O is significantly speeded up.)

       There are two  DOS  versions:  one  that  uses  an  extended
       console  driver,  and  another  that uses the BIOS directly.
       The  extended-console-driver   version   works   well   with
       "nansi.sys",  which  is widely available shareware.  It does
       not work well with the "ANSI.SYS" driver included as part of
       MSDOS  (at  least through the 3.30 version).  In order to be
       independent of the console driver, you may compile with BIOS
       #defined;  this  uses  the  BIOS as the exclusive screen I/O
       mechanism.   (Note  that  it   is   somewhat   slower   than
       nansi.sys.)

       The  color  settings  are  the  video  attributes  for   the
       alphanumeric  modes  of  the  CGA  and  monochrome displays.
       While these make most sense in binary or hex, they  must  be
       entered  in  decimal.  The reference table below gives a few
       common values:

            07    White on black          Initial default

         1.  The ability to edit files larger  than  the  available
             memory.   This  isn't a problem on the machines I use,
             but it hits the Minix-PC people pretty hard.

         2.  Macros with support for function keys.

         3.  More "set" options.

         4.  Many others...

         1.  The yank buffer uses statically allocated  memory,  so
             large  yanks  will  fail.  If  a  delete spans an area
             larger than the yank  buffer,  the  program  asks  for
             confirmation  before proceeding. That way, if you were
             moving text, you don't get screwed by the limited yank
             buffer.  You  just  have  to  move smaller chunks at a
             time. All the internal buffers (yank, redo, etc.) need
             to  be  reworked  to  allocate memory dynamically. The
             'undo' buffer is now  dynamically  allocated,  so  any
             change can be undone.

         2.  If you stay in insert mode for a long time, the insert
             buffer  can overflow.  The editor will print a message
             and dump you back into command mode.

         3.  The current  version  of  the  substitute  and  global
             commands  (i.e.  ":s/foo/bar"  or ":g/foo/d") can't be
             undone.  This is due to the current design of the undo
             code.   To undo these commands would generally involve
             unreasonable amounts of memory.

         4.  Several other less bothersome glitches...

       The editor has reached a pretty stable state,  and  performs
       well  on  the  systems  I  use  it on, so I'm pretty much in
       maintenance mode now.  There's still plenty to be done;  the
       screen  update  code  is  still  pretty  inefficient and the
       yank/put code is still primitive.  I'm still  interested  in
       bug  reports,  and I do still add a new feature from time to
       time, but the rate of change is way down now.

       I'd like to thank Tim  Thompson  for  writing  the  original
       version  of  the editor. His program was well structured and
       quite readable. Thanks for giving me a  good  base  to  work
       with.   Thanks also to many users of STEVIE who have sent in
       their changes.  Many of the  changes  I've  received  aren't
       portable  to  all  the systems I support, but I'm working to
       get portable  implementations  integrated  into  the  editor
       where possible.

       If you're reading this file, but didn't get the source  code
       for  STEVIE,  it  can  be  had by sending a disk with return
       postage to the address given below. I can  write  disks  for
       the  Atari  ST (SS or DS) or MSDOS (360K or 1.2M). Please be
       sure to include the return postage. I don't intend  to  make
       money  from  this  program,  but  I  don't  want to lose any
       either.

       that's  used  by  the  editor. In some cases characters have
       meaning in both command  and  insert  mode;  these  are  all
       described.


       ^@      The null character.  Not  used  in  any  mode.  This
               character  may not be present in the file, as is the
               case with vi.

       ^B      Backward one screen.

       ^D      Scroll the window down one half screen.

       ^E      Scroll the screen up one line.

       ^F      Forward one screen.

       ^G      Same as ":f" command. Displays file information.

       ^H      (Backspace) Moves cursor left one space  in  command
               mode.   In  insert  mode,  erases the last character
               typed.

       ^J      Move the cursor down one line.

       ^L      Clear and redraw the screen.

       ^M      (Carriage  return)  Move  to  the  first   non-white
               character  in  the  next  line.  In  insert  mode, a
               carriage return opens a new line for input.

       ^N      Move the cursor down a line.

       ^P      Move the cursor up a line.

       ^U      Scroll the window up one half screen.

       ^Y      Scroll the screen down one line.

       ^[      Escape cancels a pending command  in  command  mode,
               and is used to terminate insert mode.

       ^]      Moves to the tag whose name is given by the word  in
               which the cursor resides.

       ^`      Same as ":e #" if supported (system-dependent).

       SPACE   Move the cursor right on column.

       !       The filter operator always operates on  a  range  of
               lines,  passing the lines as input to a program, and
               replacing them with the output of the  program.  The
               shorthand  command  "!!"  can  be  used  to filter a
               number of lines (specified by  a  preceding  count).
               The  command  "!"  is  replaced  by the last command
               used, so "!!!<RETURN>"  runs  the  given  number  of
               lines through the last specified command.

               searches may be optionally terminated with a closing
               slash. To search for a slash use '\/' in the  search
               string.

       0       Move to the start of the  current  line.  Also  used
               within counts.
