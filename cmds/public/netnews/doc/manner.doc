          1.  Introduction

               USENET  is  a  worldwide  bulletin  board  system  in  which
          thousands of computers pass articles back and forth.  Of necessi-
          ty, customs have sprung  up  enabling  very  diverse  people  and
          groups  to  communicate  peaceably  and effectively using USENET.
          These customs are for the most part written,  but  are  scattered
          over  several  documents  that  can  be difficult to find; in any
          case, even if a new user can find  all  the  documents,  he  most
          likely  will  have  neither  the time nor the inclination to read
          them all.  This document is intended to collect all these conven-
          tions  into  one  place,  thereby making it easy for new users to
          learn about the world of USENET.  (Old-timers, too, will  benefit
          from reading this.)

               You should read this document and understand  it  thoroughly
          before  you even think about posting anything.  If you have ques-
          tions, please ask your USENET administrator (who can  usually  be
          reached by sending mail to _u_s_e_n_e_t) or a more knowledgeable USENET
          user.  Believe me, you will save yourself a lot of grief.

               The mechanics of posting an article to USENET are  explained
          in Mark Horton's excellent paper _H_o_w _t_o _R_e_a_d _t_h_e _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _N_e_w_s; if
          you have not read that yet, stop here and do so.  A lot  of  what
          follows  depends on your knowing (at least vaguely) the mechanics
          of posting news.

               Before we discuss these customs, we ought  to  look  at  the
          history  of  USENET, what it is today, and why we need these con-
          ventions.

          2.  All About USENET

               USENET began on a  set  of  computers  in  North  Carolina's
          Research  Triangle.   The  programs  involved (known as "netnews"
          then, and "A news" now)  exchanged  messages;  it  was  a  small,
          multi-computer  bulletin  board system.  As time passed, adminis-
          trators of other systems began to connect their computers to this
          bulletin board system.  The network grew.  Then, at Berkeley, the

9          news programs were rewritten (this version  became  known  as  "B
          news")  and  the  format  changed  to  conform  to ARPA standards
          (again, this became the "B protocol for news".*) This version  of
          news  was very widely distributed, and at this point USENET began
          to take on its current shape.

               USENET is a _l_o_g_i_c_a_l network (as opposed to a  _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l  net-
          work.)  It  is also a very amorphous network, in that there is no
          central administration or controlling site.  There is not even an
          official list of members, although there is a very complete unof-
          ficial one.  A site gets access to USENET by finding  some  other
          site  already  on USENET that it can connect to and exchange news
          articles.  So long as this second site (called a _n_e_i_g_h_b_o_r of  the
          first site) remains willing and able to pass articles to and from
          the first site, the first site is on USENET.  A site  leaves  the
          USENET  only  when no one is willing or able to pass articles to,
          or accept articles from, it.

               As a result, USENET has no equivalent of a "sysop"  or  cen-
          tral  authority controlling the bulletin board.  What little con-
          trol is exercised is wielded by the person at each  site  who  is
          responsible for maintaining the USENET connecions (this person is
          called the "USENET administrator.") Because most USENET  adminis-
          trators are (relatively) new to USENET, and because administering
          USENET locally involves a great deal of  work,  most  USENET  ad-
          ministrators  tend to follow the lead of other, more experienced,
          administrators  (often  known  somewhat  irreverently   as   "net
          gurus.") This is not an abdication of responsibility, but a means
          of keeping the amount of work little enough so  it  can  be  done
          without  interfering  with  the local USENET administrator's job.
          An example of this is the list  of  currently  active  newsgroups
          circulated  every month or so.  It is not "official" - no one has
          that authority - but as the maintainer is  doing  the  work  that
          every  other  USENET administrator would have to do otherwise, it
          is accepted as a valid list.  If the maintainer changes the  list
          in  a  way  another USENET administrator finds unacceptable, that
          administrator can simply ignore  the  list.   (Incidentally,  the
          "net  gurus"  became  known as such because of the work they have
          contributed to USENET.  Their experience is a  valuable  resource
          for each USENET administrator.)

               Because the USENET has grown so wildly, a number of problems
          have  appeared.  One of these problems is technical, and a number
          of the conventions this document describes spring  from  attempts
          to keep this problem under control.

               The technical problem arises due to the transport  mechanism
          used  by most USENET sites.  Most computers on USENET do not have
          access to large-area networks like ARPANET.  As a result the only

9          viable transport mechanism these sites can use is a set  of  pro-
          grams collectively known as UUCP and which communicate over dial-
          up telephone lines.  Initially, news programs generated one  UUCP
          command  per  article.   With  the  explosion  of the USENET, the
          number of articles simply swamped many sites; phone  lines  would
          be  tied up all day transmitting news, and many articles would be
          processed at the same time, slowing down  the  computers  notice-
          ably.

               The solution was to batch messages.  This way, many articles
          are  sent  via  UUCP with one command, and the command on the re-
          ceiving machine would split  the  file  into  separate  articles,
          which could then be processed individually.  While this increased
          the size of the files being sent, it cut down on  the  number  of
          UUCP  commands sent, and since sending a command involves quite a
          bit of overhead, this decreased the duration of phone calls,  and
          to a lesser degree the load on the computer.  At some sites, such
          as Purdue, this was not quite enough, so a simple spooler was im-
          plemented to process the individual articles one at a time.  This
          reduced the system load to a very acceptable amount.

               However, the problem has not gone away by any means.  In one
          sense  it  has  become  worse; as more articles are posted to the
          network, phone costs and system loads averages increase, and sys-
          tem  administrators  require USENET administrators to cut back or
          eliminate newsgroups and to transmit news only  at  night  (which
          means  long propagation delays).  In short, everyone who has any-
          thing to do with administering any USENET site is very  concerned
          about the future of USENET, both in general and at his own site.

               Many of the rules you will read address this  concern.   The
          fear  that  USENET may collapse is not a bogeyman, but very real.
          We hope it will not collapse, and the rules  below  outline  some
          ways  to prevent problems and increase the likelihood that enough
          sites will remain on USENET to keep it alive.  There is  no  cen-
          tral authority that can force you to follow them, but by doing so
          you will help keep USENET a valuable  resource  to  the  computer
          community.

          3.  Deciding to Post

               Before you decide to post an article, you should consider  a
          few things.

          3.1.  Do not repeat postings

               This applies even if you did not post  the  information  the
          first  time around.  If you know the answer to a question someone
          asked, first read the followups, and if you have  something  more
          to  contribute, mail it to the questioner; if you think it should
          be seen by others, ask the questioner to summarize the answers he
          receives in a subsequent article.  One of the biggest problems on
          USENET is that many copies of the same answer to a  simple  ques-
          tion are posted.

9               If you want to repost something because you believe  it  did
          not  get to other USENET sites due to transmission problems (this
          happens sometimes, but a lot less often than commonly  believed),
          do  some  checking  before  you  repost.  If you have a friend at
          another USENET site, call him and ask if the article made  it  to
          his site.  Ask your USENET administrator if he knows of any prob-
          lems in the USENET; there are special newsgroups to which  USENET
          administrators  subscribe  in  which problems are reported, or he
          can contact his counterparts at other sites for information.  Fi-
          nally,  if you decide you must repost it, indicate in the article
          subject that it is a reposting, and say why you are reposting  it
          (if you don't, you'll undoubtedly get some very nasty mail.)

               Reposting announcements of products or  services  is  flatly
          forbidden.   Doing  so  may convince other sites to turn off your
          USENET access.

               When school starts, hoards of new  users  descend  upon  the
          USENET  asking  questions.   Many  of  these  questions have been
          asked, and answered, literally thousands of  times  since  USENET
          began.   The  most  common of these questions, and their answers,
          have been collected in the hope that the new users will read them
          and  not  re-post  the  same questions.  So, if you want to ask a
          question, check Appendix I (Answers  to  Frequently  Asked  Ques-
          tions)  to  be sure it isn't one that has been asked and answered
          literally hundreds  of  times  before  you  started  reading  the
          USENET.

          3.2.  Do not post anything when upset, angry, or intoxicated

               Posting an article is a lot like driving a car - you have to
          be  in  control of yourself.  Postings which begin "Jane, you ig-
          norant slut, ..." are very definitely considered in poor  taste*.
          Unfortunately, they are also far too common.

               The psychology of this is interesting.  One  popular  belief
          is that since we interact with USENET via computers, we all often
          forget that a computer did not do the posting; a  human  did.   A
          contributing  factor is that you don't have to look the target of
          abuse in the eye when you post  an  abusive  message;  eye-to-eye
          contact  has  an amazing effect on inhibiting obnoxious behavior.
          As a result, discussions on the USENET often  degenerate  into  a
          catfight far more readily than would a face-to-face discussion.

               Before you post an article, think a minute;  decide  whether
          or not you are upset, angry, or high.  If you are, wait until you
          calm down (or come down) before deciding to post something.  Then
          think  about whether or not you really want to post it.  You will
          be amazed what waiting a day or even a few hours can do for  your
          perspective.

9               Bear in mind that shouting hasn't convinced anyone  of  any-
          thing since the days of Charlemagne, and being abusive makes peo-
          ple hold even more tenaciously to their ideas or opinions.   Gen-
          tleness,  courtesy,  and  eloquence  are far more persuasive; not
          only do they indicate you have enough confidence in your words to
          allow them to speak for you, but also they indicate a respect for
          your audience.  This in turn makes it easier for your audience to
          like  or  respect you - and people tend to be far more interested
          in, and receptive to, arguments advanced by those  they  like  or
          respect  than by writers who are abusive.  Finally, remember that
          some discussions or situations simply cannot  be  resolved.   Be-
          cause people are different, agreed-upon facts often lead to wild-
          ly different feelings and  conclusions.   These  differences  are
          what  makes life so wonderful; were we all alike, the world would
          be a very boring place.  So, don't get frantic; relax  and  enjoy
          the discussion.  Who knows, you might even learn something!

          3.3.  Be sure your posting is appropriate to USENET

               Some things are inappropriate to post to USENET.  Discussing
          whether  or not some other discussion is appropriate, or if it is
          in the right newsgroup, is an example.   Invariably,  the  "meta-
          discussion"  generates  so  many  articles that the discussion is
          simply overwhelmed and vanishes; but the meta-discussion  lingers
          on  for  several weeks, driving most of the readers of that news-
          group out of their collective minds.  Help preserve the sanity of
          your fellow USENET readers by mailing such comments to the people
          involved, rather than posting them.

               Another example of inappropriate postings  is  the  infamous
          "spelling  flame."  Every few months someone takes another poster
          to task for poor spelling or grammar.  Soon,  everyone  jumps  on
          the  bandwagon, tearing apart one another's postings for such er-
          rors.  To put it mildly, this angers almost everyone involved for
          no  real  reason.  Please remember that we all make mistakes, and
          there are a lot of people for whom English is a second  language.
          So,  try to keep your spelling and grammar comments to yourself -
          but if you find you simply cannot, mail them to the poster rather
          than posting them.

               Far more insidious are requests similar to "How can I splice
          into  the local cable TV transmission line?" Posting to USENET is
          akin to publishing, so don't ask for or post instructions on  how
          to do something illegal.  And please don't quote the First Amend-
          ment, or the laws allowing freedom of  speech  in  your  country;
          while the posting programs will not stop you, the aftermath could
          be very unpleasant - lawsuits and court trials usually  are,  and
          the  USENET  would certainly collapse as sites dropped from it to
          protect themselves from legal liability.  You wouldn't want  that
          on your conscience, would you?  Of course not.

               Related to this is the next rule.

9          3.4.  Do not post other people's work without permission

               Posting something to USENET puts it in the public domain for
          all practical purposes.  So, be careful about posting things like
          UNIX8*9-related material (specifically source code) or company  do-
          cuments;  consider  licensing and nondisclosure agreements first.
          Some people regard the posting of  "diffs" based on licensed code
          to be a suitable compromise, as they are only useful to those who
          have the base code already.

               Copyrighted works  are  a  separate  problem.   Both  United
          States  and  international law provide protection for copyrighted
          works; other than short extracts for purposes of  criticism,  you
          cannot  copy  a copyrighted work in whole or in part without per-
          mission of the copyright holder (who may, or may not, be the  au-
          thor.)  Without this protection, artists could not make any money
          and hence would have limited incentive  to  make  the  fruits  of
          their  art  available at all.  Posting a copyrighted work without
          permission is theft, even though the property stolen is not  tan-
          gible in most cases.  Hence, posting movie and book reviews, song
          lyrics, or anything else which is copyrighted without the permis-
          sion  of  the  copyright holder, could cause you personally, your
          company, or the USENET itself to  be  held  liable  for  damages.
          Please  be  very  careful that you obey the law when posting such
          material!

          3.5.  Don't forget that opinions are those of the poster and  not
          his employer.

               Every so often, someone will post a particularly  disgusting
          article,  and  a number of responses will ask if all employees of
          the original poster's company share his (revolting)  opinion,  or
          suggest  that  action  be  taken  against  that  company.  Please
          remember that all opinions or statements in articles  are  to  be
          attributed  to  the poster _o_n_l_y, and in particular, do not neces-
          sarily represent the opinions of the poster's employer, the owner
          of  the  computer  on which the article originated, or anyone in-
          volved with any aspect of USENET - and consequently the responsi-
          bility  for  any USENET message rests with the poster and with no
          one else.  The appropriate response is not to attack the  company
          or its other employees; let the poster know what you think of his
          posting via mail.  If the postings continue,  take  advantage  of

9          postings.

               In some countries, posting or receiving certain types of ar-
          ticles  may  be  a  criminal offense.  As a result, certain news-
          groups which circulate freely within the United States may not be
          circulated in other nations without risking civil or criminal li-
          abilities.  In this case, the appropriate  action  for  sites  in
          that  country is neither to accept nor to transmit the newsgroup.
          No site is _e_v_e_r forced to accept or pass on _a_n_y newsgroup.

          4.  Where to Post

               The various newsgroups and distributions have various  rules
          associated  with  their  use.   This  section will describe these
          rules and offer suggestions on which newsgroups to post your mes-
          sage.

          4.1.  Keep the distribution as limited as possible

               A basic principle of posting is to keep the distribution  of
          your  article  as  limited as possible.  Like our modern society,
          USENET is suffering from both an information glut and information
          pollution.   It  is widely believed that the USENET will cease to
          function unless we are able to cut down the quantity of articles.
          One  step  in  this  direction is not to post something to places
          where it will be worthless.  For example, if you live in  Hacken-
          sack,  New  Jersey, the probability of anyone in Korea wanting to
          buy your 1972 Toyota is about as close to zero as  you  can  get.
          So confine your posting to the New Jersey area.

               To do this, you can either post to a local group, or post to
          a  net-wide  group  and use the _d_i_s_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n feature to limit how
          widely your article will go.  When you give your posting  program
          (usually _p_o_s_t_n_e_w_s(1)) a distribution, you are (in essence) saying
          that machines which do not recognize that distribution should not
          get  the  article.   (Think of it as a subgroup based on locality
          and you'll get the idea.) For example, if you are posting in  the
          San Francisco Bay Area, and you post your article to rec.auto but
          give ba as the distribution, the article will not be sent  beyond
          the  San  Francisco Bay Area (to which the ba distribution is lo-
          cal) even though you put it in a  net-wide  newsgroup.   Had  you
          given  the distribution as ca (the California distribution), your
          article would have been sent to all Californian sites on  USENET.
          Had  you given the distribution as world, your article would have
          been sent to all sites on USENET.

          4.2.  Do not post the same article twice to different groups

               If you have an article that you want to post  to  more  than
          one  group, post to both at the same time.  Newer versions of the
          news software will show an article only once  regardless  of  how
          many  newsgroups  it appears in.  But if you post it once to each
          different group, all versions of news software will show it  once
          for  each  newsgroup.   This  angers  a  lot of people and wastes

9          everybody's time.

          4.3.  Do not post to moderated newsgroups.

               You may not post directly to certain newsgroups; you  cannot
          post  to  some  at all.  Newer versions of the news software will
          inform you when either of these  restrictions  apply,  but  older
          versions of news software will not.

               If you want to have the  appropriate  moderator  post  some-
          thing,  mail  it  to  the moderator.  (If you do not know the ad-
          dress,  ask  your  USENET  administrator.   In  some  cases,  the
          software  will automatically mail, rather than post, your article
          to the moderator.)

          4.4.  Ask someone if you can't figure out where to post your  ar-
          ticle

               If you cannot figure out where to post  something,  look  in
          news.announce.newusers  for the list of active newsgroups.  (This
          is posted biweekly.  If you can't find it, look at  the  list  in
          _H_o_w  _t_o _R_e_a_d _t_h_e _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _N_e_w_s; but be aware that list is undoubt-
          edly out of date already.) If your article does not seem  to  fit
          in  any  of the listed groups, post it to misc.misc or don't post
          it.

               If you still are not sure which newsgroup to post your arti-
          cle  to,  ask  an  old-timer.  If your site doesn't have any old-
          timers (or none of  the  old-timers  will  admit  to  being  old-
          timers), contact any of the following people:

               Gene Spafford (spaf@gatech.CSNET, spaf@gatech.UUCP)
               Mark Horton (mark@cbosgd.UUCP)
               Rick Adams (rick@seismo.CSS.GOV, rick@seismo.UUCP)
               Chuq Von Rospach (chuq@sun.UUCP)
               Matt Bishop (mab@riacs.ARPA, mab@riacs.UUCP)

          We will be happy to help you.  But, please, do not post the arti-
          cle to the net before you ask us!

          4.5.  Be sure there is a consensus before creating  a  new  news-
          group

               Creating a new newsgroup is, in general, a  very  bad  idea.
          Currently,  there  are  so  many  articles  being posted that the
          USENET is in dange of collapse as  site  after  site  decides  to
          cease  to  accept  and  retransmit certain newsgroups.  Moreover,
          there is no established procedure for deleting  a  newsgroup,  so
          once  created, newsgroups tend to stay around.  They also tend to
          encourage people to think up new newsgroups, and  the  cycle  re-
          peats.  Try to avoid thinking up new newsgroups.

               If, however, you believe a new group should be  created,  be
          sure  you  have  a  consensus  that the group is needed (either a

9          mailing list has enough traffic and readers to justify turning it
          into  a newsgroup, or a discussion in a current newsgroup becomes
          so large for a period of time long enough to warrant splitting it
          into  a newsgroup.) Then post an article to news.group as well as
          any other groups related to your proposed new group, and  discuss
          the  topics  you are proposing be covered in your new group, what
          it should be called, whether it is _r_e_a_l_l_y needed, and  so  forth.
          Try  to resolve all objections, and take into account all sugges-
          tions and comments; finally, have everyone mail you  a  "yes"  or
          "no"  vote on whether the group should be created.  Try to get at
          least 40 or 50 "yes" votes before creating the group; if you want
          to be safe, get around 100.

          4.6.  Watch out for newsgroups which  have  special  rules  about
          posting

               Some newsgroups have special rules.  This section summarizes
          them.

          rec.arts.books      Do not post anything revealing a  plot  or  a
                              plot twist without putting the word "spoiler"
                              somewhere in the "Subject" field.  This  will
                              let  those who do not wish to have a surprise
                              spoiled skip the article.

          rec.humor           If you want to post an offensive  joke  (this
                              includes  racial, religious, sexual, and sca-
                              talogical humor, among  other  kinds)  rotate
                              it.   (If  you  do  not know what this means,
                              look in the section Writing Your Posting.)

          rec.arts.movies     Do not post anything revealing a  plot  or  a
                              plot twist without putting the word "spoiler"
                              in the "Subject" field.  This will let  those
                              who  do  not  wish to have a surprise spoiled
                              skip the article.

          news.group          Discussions about whether or  not  to  create

          5.  Writing the Article

               Here are some suggestions to help you communicate effective-
          ly  with others on the USENET.  Perhaps the best advice is not to
          be afraid to consult a book on writing style; two of the best are
          _H_o_w  _t_o  _W_r_i_t_e  _f_o_r _t_h_e _W_o_r_l_d _o_f _W_o_r_k by Cunningham and Pearsall,
          and _E_l_e_m_e_n_t_s _o_f _S_t_y_l_e by Strunk and White.

          5.1.  Write for your audience

               USENET is an international network, and any article you post
          will be _v_e_r_y widely read.  Even more importantly, your future em-
          ployers may be among the readers!  So, try to make a good impres-
          sion.

               A basic principle  of  all  writing  is  to  write  at  your
          readers'  reading  level.   It  is better to go below than above.
          Aiming where "their heads ought to be" may be fine if you  are  a
          college  professor (and a lot of us would dispute even that), but
          it is guaranteed to cause people to ignore your article.  Studies
          have  shown  that  the  average American reads at the fifth grade
          level and the average professional reads  at  the  twelfth  grade
          level.

          5.2.  Be clear and concise

               Remember that you are writing for a very busy audience; your
          readers  will not puzzle over your article.  So be very clear and
          very concise.  Be precise as well;  choose  the  least  ambiguous
          word  you  can,  taking into account the context in which you are
          using the word.  Split your posting into sections and  paragraphs
          as  appropriate.  Use a descriptive title in the "Subject" field,
          and be sure that the title is related to the body of the article.
          If  the  title  is not related, feel free to change it to a title
          that is.

          5.3.  Proofread your article

               This is a matter of courtesy; since you want others to  read
          your article, the least you can do is check that it says what you
          mean in a clear, concise manner.  Check for typographical errors,
          silly  grammar  errors,  and misspellings; if you have a spelling
          checking program, use it.  Also be sure the article  is  easy  to
          read.   Use  white  space - blanks, tabs, and newlines - and both
          upper and lower case letters.  Do not omit the definite and inde-
          finite  articles, either; not only do "a", "an", and "the" make a
          posting much easier to read, their omission can  make  a  posting
          ambiguous.

9          5.4.  Be extra careful with announcements of products or services

               When writing a product or service announcement, bear in mind
          that  others  will be paying most of the telephone bills.  So, if
          you are announcing several things, combine all the  announcements
          into  one  article.  Mark the posting as a product or service an-
          nouncement in the title in the "Subject" field.  Advertising  hy-
          perbole  is  not appropriate here; remember that your audience is
          to a large degree technically literate,  and  your  product  will
          stand or fall on its technical merits.  Be aware that posting ob-
          noxious or inappropriate advertisements is very  serious  and  if
          you  do  it,  you may find your neighbors yanking your USENET ac-
          cess.

          5.5.  Indicate sarcasm and humor

               Remember that people cannot see  you  when  they  read  your
          posting;  hence, all the subtle nuances of body and facial motion
          are hidden.  It can be quite difficult to tell when you are being
          sarcastic  or  humorous.   To  deal with this problem, the USENET
          readers and posters have developed a special sign.  Mark passages
          you  intend to be taken as humorous with the "smiley face", while
          looks like this: ":-)".  (Think of a head facing you lying on its
          right side and look again if you don't understand why that symbol
          was chosen.) As for sarcasm, there is  no  universal  symbol  for
          that  (unless  the sarcasm is meant humorously, in which case use
          the smiley face again.) But mark your passage  so  everyone  will
          realize you are being sarcastic.

          5.6.  Mark postings which spoil surprises

               High on the list of obnoxious messages are those that  spoil
          the  plot of a book or movie by giving away an unexpected detail.
          If you post such an article, please put the word "spoiler" in the
          "Subject"  field  of  your  posting, so people who do not wish to
          have a surprise ruined can skip the article.

          5.7.  Rotate offensive postings

               If you feel you must post a message that may offend  people,
          you  can  do one of two things.  You can post it to the newsgroup
          talk.flame or you can take steps to be sure the message will only
          be  read  by those who explicitly ask for it to be shown to them.
          In the latter case, the USENET convention  is  to  encrypt  these
          messages  by shifting each letter 13 characters, so that (for ex-
          ample) "a" becomes "n".  (In more precise terms, this is a Caesar
          cipher  of shift 13; on the USENET, it is called _r_o_t_1_3.) When you
          do this, put the word "rot13" in the "Subject" field.   The  news
          reader  you  are  using almost certainly has a command to encrypt
          and decrypt such messages; if not, use the UNIX command

                               tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M

9          5.8.  The shorter your signature, the better

               Keep signatures concise; 2 or 3 lines  are  usually  plenty.
          Include  your  name  and addresses on any major networks (such as
          ARPANET, BITNET, or CSNET).  This helps people contact you quick-
          ly  and easily, usually more so than by following the return path
          of the article.  Do not include pictures, graphics or clever quo-
          tations that make the signature longer; this is not the appropri-
          ate place for them, and many sites resent paying the phone  bills
          for such signatures.

          6.  Conclusion and Summary

               The USENET can be a great place  for  us  all.   Sadly,  not
          enough  people  are  following  the  customs that have been esta-
          blished to keep the USENET civilized.  This document was  written
          to  educate  all  users  of the USENET on their responsibilities.
          Let's clean up the USENET, and turn it into a  friendly,  helpful
          community again!

               This document discusses some items that occur repeatedly  on
          USENET.   They  frequently are submitted by new users, and result
          in many followups, sometimes swamping groups for weeks.  The pur-
          pose of this note is to head off these annoying events by answer-
          ing some questions and warning about the  inevitable  consequence
          of  asking others.  If you don't like my answers, let me know and
          I may include revisions in future versions of this note.

           1. What does UNIX stand for?

              It is not an acronym, but is a pun on "MULTICS." MULTICS is a
              large  operating  system that was being developed shortly be-
              fore UNIX was created.

           2. What is the derivation of "foo" as a filler word?

              The favorite story is that it comes from "fubar" which is  an
              acronym for "fouled up beyond all recognition," which is sup-
              posed to be a military term.  (Various forms of  this  exist,
              "fouled"  usually  being  replaced by a stronger word.) "Foo"
              and "Bar" have the same derivation.

           3. Is a machine at "foo" on the net?

              These questions belong in news.config  if  anywhere,  but  in
              fact  your  best bet is usually to phone somebody at "foo" to
              find out.  If you don't know anybody at "foo" you can  always
              try  calling  and asking for the "computer center." Also, see
              the newsgroup mod.map, where maps of USENET and the UUCP net-
              work are posted regularly.

           4. What does "rc" at the end of files like ._n_e_w_s_r_c mean?

              According to Dennis Ritchie, "The name _r_c comes from  RUNCOM,
              which was the rough equivalent on the MIT CTSS system of what
              UNIX calls shell scripts.  Of course, RUNCOM derives from _r_u_n
              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s."

           5. What do "- (nf)" and "Orphaned Response" in an  item's  title
              mean?

              It means that the item was created by "notefiles," an  alter-
              native  news  handling interface that many people prefer.  If
              you want to find out more you can read the  _N_o_t_e_s_f_i_l_e  System
              Reference Manual" or contact _u_i_u_c_d_c_s!_e_s_s_i_c_k.

9           6. What does ":-)" mean?

              This is the net convention for a "smiley face." It means that
              something  is  being said in jest.  If it doesn't look like a
              smiley face to you, flop your head over to the left and  look
              again.

           7. How do I decrypt jokes in rec.humor?

              The standard cipher used in rec.humor in called "rot13." Each
              letter  is replaced by the letter 13 further along in the al-
              phabet (cycling around at the  end).   Most  systems  have  a
              built  in  command  to decrypt such articles; _r_e_a_d_n_e_w_s(1) and
              _v_n_e_w_s(1) have the D command, _r_n(1) (another  popular  public-
              domain full screen news reader) has the X or <CONTROL-X> com-
              mands, _n_o_t_e_s(1) has % or R.  If your system  doesn't  have  a
              program  to encrypt and decrypt these, you can quickly create
              a shell script using _t_r(1):

                               tr A-Za-z N-ZA-Mn-za-m

              On some versions of UNIX, the _t_r command  should  be  written
              as:

                  tr "[a-m][n-z][A-M][N-Z]" "[n-z][a-m][N-Z][A-M]"

           8. soc.net-people: Is John Doe out there anywhere?

              I suspect that these items are people  looking  for  freshman
              roommates  that  they haven't seen in ten years.  If you have
              some idea where the person is you are usually better off cal-
              ling  the  organization.   For  example, if you call any Bell
              Labs location and request John Doe's number.  They  can  give
              it to you even if he works at a different location.

           9. sci.math: Proofs that 1 = 0.

              Almost everyone has seen one or more of these in high school.
              They  are almost always based on either division by 0 or tak-
              ing the square root of a negative number.

          10. rec.games: Where can I get the source for  _e_m_p_i_r_e(6)  or  _r_o_-
              _g_u_e(6)?

              You can't.  The authors of these games, as  is  their  right,
              have chosen not to make the sources available.

          11. comp.unix.wizards: How do I remove files with non-ASCII char-
              acters in their names?

              You can try to find a pattern that  uniquely  identifies  the
              file.   This  sometimes  fails  because a peculiarity of some
              shells is that they strip off the high-order bit  of  charac-
              ters  in command lines.  Next, you can try an "rm -i", or "rm

9              -r" (see _r_m(1).) Finally, you can  mess  around  with  i-node
              numbers and _f_i_n_d(1).

          12. comp.unix.wizards: There is a bug in  the  way  UNIX  handles
              protection for programs that run setuid.

              There are indeed problems with the treatment of protection in
              setuid  programs.   When  this is brought up, suggestions for
              changes range from implementing a full  capability  list  ar-
              rangement  to new kernel calls for allowing more control over
              when the effective id is used and when the real id is used to
              control  accesses.  Sooner or later you can expect this to be
              improved.  For now you just have to live with it.

          13. soc.women: What do you think about abortion?

              Although abortion might appear to be an appropriate topic for
              soc.women,  more  heat  than  light  is  generated when it is
              brought up.   Since  the  newsgroup  talk.abortion  has  been
              created,  all  abortion-related  discussion should take place
              there.

          14. soc.singles: What do "MOTOS,"  "MOTSS,",  "MOTAS",  and  "SO"
              stand for?

              Member of the opposite sex, member of the same sex, member of
              the appropriate sex, and significant other, respectively.

          15. How do I use the "Distribution" feature?

              When _p_o_s_t_n_e_w_s(1) prompts you for a distribution, it's  asking
              how  widely  distributed  you  want your article.  The set of
              possible replies is different, depending on  where  you  are,
              but  at  Bell  Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, possibilities
              include:

                       mh3bc1  local to this machine
                       mh      Bell Labs, Murray Hill Branch
                       nj      all sites in New Jersey
                       btl     All Bell Labs machines
                       att     All AT&T machines
                       usa     Everywhere in the USA
                       na      Everywhere in North America
                       world   Everywhere on USENET in the world

              If you hit <RETURN>, you'll get the  default,  which  is  the
              first  part of the newsgroup name.  This default is often not
              appropriate - _p_l_e_a_s_e take a moment to  think  about  how  far
              away  people  are likely to be interested in what you have to
              say.  Used car ads, housing wanted ads, and things  for  sale
              other  than  specialized  equipment  like computers certainly
              shouldn't be distributed to Europe and Korea, or even to  the
              next state.

9              The newsgroup misc.forsale exists for postings  of  sale  an-
              nouncements.   Its  distribution is limited to North America;
              posters should restrict this distribution  even  further,  if
              possible and appropriate.

          16. Why do some people put funny lines ("bug killers") at the be-
              ginning of their articles?

              Some earlier versions of news had a bug which would drop  the
              first 512 or 1024 bytes of text of certain articles.  The bug
              was triggered whenever the article started with whitespace (a
              blank  or  a  tab).   A  fix many people adopted was to begin
              their articles with a line containing a character other  than
              white  space.   This  gradually evolved into the habit of in-
              cluding amusing first lines.

              The original bug has since been fixed  in  newer  version  of
              news, and sites running older versions of news have applied a
              patch to prevent articles from losing text.  The "bug-killer"
              lines  are  therefore  probably  no  longer  needed, but they
              linger on.

          17. What is the address or phone number of the "foo" company?

              Try the white and  yellow  pages  of  your  phone  directory,
              first; a sales representative will surely know, and if you're
              a potential customer they will be  who  you're  looking  for.
              Phone  books  for  other  cities are usually available in li-
              braries of any size.  Whoever buys or recommends  things  for
              your  company  will  probably have some buyer's guides or na-
              tional company directories.  Call or visit the reference desk
              of  your  library; they have several company and organization
              directories and many will answer questions like this over the
              phone.   Remember if you only know the city where the company
              is, you can telephone to find out their  full  address  or  a
              dealer.   The network is _n_o_t a free resource, although it may
              look like that to some people.  It is far better to  spend  a
              few  minutes  of  your  own time researching an answer rather
              than broadcast your laziness and/or ineptitude to the net.
