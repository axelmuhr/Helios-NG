               I am an attorney practicing copyright law and computer  law.
          I  read  a series of queries in net.legal about copyright law and
          was dismayed to find that people who had no idea what  they  were
          talking  about  were  spreading  misinformation over the network.
          Considering that the penalties for copyright infringement can in-
          clude  $50,000.00  damages  per  infringed  work, attorneys fees,
          court costs, criminal fines  and  imprisonment,  and  considering
          that  ignorance  is  no  excuse and innocent intent is not even a
          recognized defense, I cringe to see the network used as a soapbox
          for the ill-informed.  For that reason, this article will discuss
          copyright law  and  license  law  as  they  pertain  to  computer
          software.

               My goal is to enable readers to determine when  they  should
          be  concerned  about infringing and when they can relax about it.
          I also want to let programmers know how to obtain  copyright  for
          their  work.   I'll explain the purpose of software licenses, and
          discuss the effect that the license has on copyright.  For  those
          of  you who are programmers, I'll help you decide whether you own
          the programs you write on the job or your boss owns them.  I will
          also  mention  trademark  law and patent law briefly, in order to
          clarify some confusion about which is  which.   Incidentally,  if
          you read this entire essay, you will be able to determine whether
          or not the essay is copyrighted and whether or not you can make a
          printout of it.

               This is a long article, and you may not want to read all  of
          it.   Here is an outline to help you decide what to read and what

          1.  The Meaning of Copyright from the Viewpoint of  the  Software
          User

          1.1.  A bit of history

               If you're not interested in history, you can skip this para-
          graph.   _M_o_d_e_r_n  copyright law first came into existence in 1570,
          by an act of Parliament called the Statute of  Anne.   Like  most
          laws,  it  hasn't  changed much since.  It was written with books
          and pictures in  mind.   Parliament,  lacking  the  foresight  to
          predict  the success of the Intel and IBM corporations, failed to
          consider the issue of copyrighting computer programs.

               At first, courts questioned whether programs could be  copy-
          righted  at  all.   The problem was that judges couldn't read the
          programs and they figured the Copyright Law was only meant to ap-
          ply  to things humans (which arguably includes judges) could read
          without the aid of a machine.  I  saw  some  mythical  discussion
          about  that  in  some of the net.legal drivel.  Let's lay that to
          rest:  programs are copyrightable as long  as  there  is  even  a
          minimal  amount  of  creativity.  The issue was laid to rest with
          the Software Act of 1980.  That Act modified  the  Copyright  Act
          (which  is a Federal law by the way), in such a way as to make it

9          clear that programs are copyrightable.   The  few  exceptions  to
          this rule will rarely concern anyone.  The next question to arise
          was whether a program was copyrightable if it was stored  in  ROM
          rather  than  on  paper.    The decision in the Apple v. Franklin
          case laid that to rest:  it is.

          1.2.  The meaning of _c_o_p_y_r_i_g_h_t

               Now, what is copyright?  As it is commonly understood, it is
          the  right  to make copies of something -- or to put it the other
          way around, it is the right to prohibit other people from  making
          copies.   This  is  known  as an exclusive right -- the exclusive
          right to _r_e_p_r_o_d_u_c_e, in the biological language of  the  Copyright
          Act -- and what most people don't know is that copyright involves
          not one, not two, but five exclusive rights. These  are  (1)  the
          exclusive  right  to make copies, (2) the exclusive right to dis-
          tribute copies to the public, (3) the exclusive right to  prepare
          _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e  _w_o_r_k_s  (I'll explain, just keep reading), (4) the ex-
          clusive right to perform the work in public (this mainly  applies
          to  plays,  dances and the like, but it could apply to software),
          and (5) the exclusive right to display the work in  public  (such
          as showing a film).

          1.3.  The meaning of _p_u_b_l_i_c _d_o_m_a_i_n

               Before we go any further, what is public domain?  I saw some
          discussion  on  the  net about public domain software being copy-
          righted.  Nonsense.  The phrase _p_u_b_l_i_c _d_o_m_a_i_n, when used correct-
          ly,  means the absence of copyright protection.  It means you can
          copy public domain software to your heart's  content.   It  means
          that  the  author  has none of the exclusive rights listed above.
          If someone uses the phrase _p_u_b_l_i_c _d_o_m_a_i_n  to  refer  to  _f_r_e_e_w_a_r_e
          (software which is copyrighted but is distributed without advance
          payment but with a request for a donation), he or  she  is  using
          the term incorrectly.  Public domain means no copyright -- no ex-
          clusive rights.

          1.4.  A hypothetical software purchase

               Let's look at those exclusive rights from the  viewpoint  of
          someone  who  has legitimately purchased a single copy of a copy-
          righted computer program.  For the moment, we'll have  to  ignore
          the  fact  that  the  program is supposedly licensed, because the
          license changes things.  I'll explain that later.  For  now,  as-
          sume  you  went  to  Fred's  Diner and Software Mart and bought a
          dozen eggs, cat food and a word processing program.  And for now,
          assume the program is copyrighted.

          1.5.  Can you use copyrighted software?

               What can you do with this copyrighted software?  Let's start
          with  the obvious:  can you use it on your powerful Timex PC?  Is
          this a joke?  No.  Prior to 1980, my answer might have  been  No,
          you can't use it!

9               People actually pay me for advice like  that!   Well  think:
          you  take the floppy disk out of the zip lock baggy, insert it in
          drive A and load the program into RAM.  What have you just  done?
          You've  made  a copy in RAM -- in legalese, you've reproduced the
          work, in violation of the copyright owner's  exclusive  right  to
          reproduce.  (I better clarify something here:  the copyright own-
          er is the person or company whose name appears in  the  copyright
          notice  on  the box, or the disk or the first screen or wherever.
          It may be the person who wrote the program,  or  it  may  be  his
          boss, or it may be a publishing company that bought the rights to
          the program.  But in any case, it's not you. When you buy a  copy
          of  the program, you do not become the copyright owner.  You just
          own one copy.)

               Anyway, loading the program into RAM means  making  a  copy.
          The Software Act of 1980 addressed this absurdity by allowing you
          to make a copy if the copy "is created as an  essential  step  in
          the  utilization  of  the  computer program in conjunction with a
          machine and ...  is used in no other manner ...."   By  the  way,
          somebody  tell me what _a _m_a_c_h_i_n_e means.  If you connect 5 PC's on
          a network is that _a _m_a_c_h_i_n_e or _s_e_v_e_r_a_l _m_a_c_h_i_n_e_s?  A related ques-
          tion  is whether or not running software on a network constitutes
          a performance.  The copyright owner has the exclusive right to do
          that, remember?

          1.6.  Can you make a backup copy?

               OK, so you bought this copyrighted program and you loaded it
          into  RAM  or  onto  a hard disk without the FBI knocking on your
          door.  Now can you make a backup copy?  YES.   The  Software  Act
          also  provided  that you can make a backup copy, provided that it
          "is for archival purposes only ...."  What you cannot do,  howev-
          er,  is give the archive copy to your friend so that you and your
          pal both got the program for the price of one.  That violates the
          copyright  owner's  exclusive  right  to distribute copies to the
          public.  Get it?  You can, on the other hand, give both your ori-
          ginal  and backup to your friend -- or sell it to him, or lend it
          to him, as long as you don't retain a copy of the program you are
          selling.  Although the copyright owner has the exclusive right to
          distribute (sell) copies of the program, that right only  applies
          to the first sale of any particular copy.  By analogy, if you buy
          a copyrighted book, you are free to sell your book to  a  friend.
          The copyright owner does not have the right to control resales.

          1.7.  Licenses may change the rules

               At this point, let me remind you that we have  assumed  that
          the program you got at the store was sold to you, not licensed to
          you.  Licenses may change the rules.

          1.8.  Can you modify the program?

               Now, you're a clever programmer, and you  know  the  program
          could  run  faster  with  some  modifications. You could also add

9          graphics and an interactive mode and lots of other  stuff.   What
          does  copyright  law say about your plans?  Well ... several dif-
          ferent things, actually.  First, recall that the copyright  owner
          has  the  exclusive right to make derivative works.  A derivative
          work is a work based on one or more preexisting works.  It's easy
          to  recognize  derivative  works  when  you  think about music or
          books.  If a book is copyrighted, derivative works could  include
          a  screenplay, an abridged edition, or a translation into another
          language.  Derivative works of songs might  be  new  arrangements
          (like  the  jazz  version  of  Love  Potion  Number  9),  a movie
          soundtrack, or a written transcription, or a _l_o_n_g _v_e_r_s_i_o_n,  (such
          as the fifteen minute version of "Wipe Out" with an extended drum
          solo for dance parties).  In my opinion, you are making a deriva-
          tive work when you take the store-bought word processor and modi-
          fy it to perform differently.  The same  would  be  true  if  you
          _t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_e_d  a  COBOL program into BASIC.  Those are copyright in-
          fringements -- you've horned in  on  the  copyright  owner's  ex-
          clusive  right to make derivative works.  There is, however, some
          breathing room.  The Software Act generously allows you to  _a_d_a_p_t
          the  code  if  the adaptation "is created as an essential step in
          the utilization of the computer program  in  conjunction  with  a
          machine  ...."  For example, you might have to modify the code to
          make it compatible with your machine.

          1.9.  Can you break the copy protection scheme?

               Moving right along, let's assume your store  bought  program
          is  copy  protected, and you'd really like to make a backup copy.
          You  know  this  nine-year-old  whiz  who  can  crack  any  copy-
          protection scheme faster than you can rearrange a Rubix cube.  Is
          there a copyright violation if he succeeds?  There's room to  ar-
          gue here. When you try to figure out if something is an infringe-
          ment, ask yourself, what exclusive right am I violating?  In this
          case,  not the right to make copies, and not the right to distri-
          bute copies.  Public performance and display have  no  relevance.
          So  the key question is whether you are making a _d_e_r_i_v_a_t_i_v_e _w_o_r_k.
          My answer to that question is, "I doubt it."  On the other  hand,
          I  also  doubt that breaking the protection scheme was "an essen-
          tial step" in using the program in conjunction  with  a  machine.
          It  might be a "fair use," but that will have to wait for another
          article.  Anyone interested in stretching the limits of the "fair
          use" defense should read the Sony _B_e_t_a_m_a_x case.

          1.10.  Summary

               Let me summarize. Copyright means the  copyright  owner  has
          the  exclusive right to do certain things. Copyright infringement
          means you did one of those exclusive things (unless  you  did  it
          within the limits of the Software Act, i.e., as an essential step
          ....).

9          2.  Copyright Sounds Neat -- How Do I Get One?  Or, How Do I Know
          if this Program is Copyrighted?

          2.1.  How do you get a copyright?

               If you've written an original program, what do you  have  to
          do to get a copyright? Nothing. You already have one.

          2.2.  How do you lose a copyright?

               If you've written an original program, what do you  have  to
          do  to  lose your copyright protection?  Give copies away without
          the copyright notice.

          2.3.  How do you waste a stamp?

               If you mail the program to yourself in  a  sealed  envelope,
          what have you accomplished? You've wasted a stamp and an envelope
          and burdened the postal system unnecessarily.

          2.4.  Do you have to register?

               Do you have to register your program with the U.S. Copyright
          Office?  No, but it's a damn good idea.

          2.5.  How copyright comes into existence

               Copyright protection (meaning  the  five  exclusive  rights)
          comes  into existence the moment you _f_i_x your program in a _t_a_n_g_i_-
          _b_l_e _m_e_d_i_u_m.  That means write it down, or store it  on  a  floppy
          disk,  or  do  something similar.  Registration is optional.  The
          one thing you must do, however, is protect your copyright by  in-
          cluding  a  copyright  notice  on every copy of every program you
          sell, give away, lend out, etc.  If you don't, someone  who  hap-
          pens  across  your program with no notice on it can safely assume
          that it is in the public domain (unless he actually knows that it
          is not).

          2.6.  The copyright notice

               The copyright notice has three parts.  The first can be  ei-
          ther  a  c  with a circle around it (8c9), or the word Copyright or
          the abbreviation Copr.  The c with a circle around it is  prefer-
          able,  because  it is recognized around the world; the others are
          not.  That's incredibly important.  Countries  around  the  world
          have  agreed to recognize and uphold each others' copyrights, but
          this world-wide protection requires the use of the c in a circle.
          On  disk  labels and program packaging, use the encircled c.  Un-
          fortunately, computers don't draw small circles well, so program-
          mers  have  resorted  to a c in parentheses: (c).  Too bad.  That
          has no legal meaning.  When you put your notice in the  code  and
          on  the  screen, use Copyright or Copr.  if you can't make a cir-
          cle.

9               The second part of the notice is the "year of first publica-
          tion  of  the work." _P_u_b_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n doesn't mean distribution by Os-
          borne Publishing Co.  It means distribution of copies of the pro-
          gram to the public "by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by
          rental, lease, or lending."  So when you  start  handing  out  or
          selling copies of your precious code, you are publishing.  Publi-
          cation also takes place  when  you  merely  OFFER  to  distribute
          copies to a group for further distribution.  Your notice must in-
          clude the year that you first did so.

               The third part of the notice is the name of the owner of the
          copyright.   Hopefully,  that's you, in which case your last name
          will do.  If your company owns the program -- a legal issue which
          I  will  address later in this article -- the company name is ap-
          propriate.

               Where do you put the notice?  The general idea is to put  it
          where  people  are likely to see it. Specifically, if you're dis-
          tributing a human-readable code listing, put it on the first page
          in  the  first few lines of code, and hard code it so that it ap-
          pears on the title screen, or at sign-off, or  continuously.   If
          you're distributing machine-readable versions only, hard code it.
          As an extra precaution, you should also place the notice  on  the
          gummed  disk  label or in some other fashion permanently attached
          to the storage medium.

          2.7.  Advantages of registration

               Now, why register the program?  If no one ever rips off your
          program, you won't care much about registration.  If someone does
          rip it off, you'll kick yourself for not  having  registered  it.
          The  reason  is  that if the program is registered before the in-
          fringement takes place, you can recover some big bucks  from  the
          infringer,  called statutory damages, and the court can order the
          infringer to pay your attorneys fees.   Registration  only  costs
          $10.00,  and it's easy to do yourself.  The only potential disad-
          vantage is the requirement that you deposit the first and last 25
          pages  of  your  source  code,  which  can  be inspected (but not
          copied) by members of the public.

          2.8.  A test to see if you understand this article

               Now, someone tell me this:   is  this  article  copyrighted?
          Can you print it?

          3.  Who Owns The Program You Wrote?

          3.1.  Introduction

               The starting point of this analysis is that if you wrote the
          program, you are the author, and copyright belongs to the author.
          HOWEVER, that can change instantly. There are two common ways for
          your  ownership  to  shift  to someone else:  first, your program
          might be a "work for hire."  Second, you  might  sell  or  assign

9          your  _r_i_g_h_t_s  in  the  program,  which for our purposes means the
          copyright.

          3.2.  Programs written as an employee

               Most of the programs which you write at work, if not all  of
          them,  belong to your employer. That's because a program prepared
          by an employee within the scope of his or  her  employment  is  a
          "work for hire," and the employer is considered the _a_u_t_h_o_r.  This
          is more or less automatic if you are an employee  --  no  written
          agreement is necessary to make your employer the copyright owner.
          By contrast, if you can convince your employer to let you be  the
          copyright owner, you must have that agreement in writing.

               By the way, before you give up hope of owning the  copyright
          to the program you wrote at work, figure out if you are really an
          employee.  That is actually a complex legal question, but  I  can
          tell you now that just because your boss says you are an employee
          doesn't mean that it's so.  And remember that if you created  the
          program outside the _s_c_o_p_e of your job, the program is not a "work
          for hire."  Finally, in California and  probably  elsewhere,  the
          state  labor law provides that employees own products they create
          on their own time, using their own tools and  materials.  Employ-
          ment  contracts  which  attempt to make the employer the owner of
          those off-the-job _i_n_v_e_n_t_i_o_n_s are void, at least in sunny Califor-
          nia.

          3.3.  Programs written as a contractor

               Wait a minute:  I'm an independent contractor to Company  X,
          not an employee.  I come and go as I please, get paid by the hour
          with no tax withheld, and was retained  to  complete  a  specific
          project.   I  frequently  work at home with my own equipment.  Is
          the program I'm writing a "work for hire," owned by the  Company?
          Maybe,  maybe not.  In California, this area is full of landmines
          for employers, and gold for contractors.

               A contractor's program is not a "work for hire," and is  not
          owned  by  the  company,  unless (1) there is a written agreement
          between the company and the contractor which says that it is, and
          (2)  the work is a _c_o_m_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_e_d _w_o_r_k.  A _c_o_m_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_e_d _w_o_r_k is one
          of the following:  (a)  a contribution to a _c_o_l_l_e_c_t_i_v_e _w_o_r_k,  (b)
          an  audiovisual work (like a movie, and maybe like a video game),
          (c) a translation, (d) a compilation, (e) an instructional  text,
          (f) a test or answer to a test, or (g) an atlas.  I know you must
          be tired of definitions, but this is what the real legal world is
          made  of.   An example of a  collective work is a book of poetry,
          with poems contributed by various authors.  A piece of code which
          is  incorporated  into  a large program isn't a contribution to a
          collective work, but a stand-alone program which is packaged  and
          sold with other stand-alone programs could be.

               So where are we?  If you are a contract programmer,  not  an
          employee, and your program is a _c_o_m_m_i_s_s_i_o_n_e_d _w_o_r_k, and you have a

9          written agreement that says that the program is a "work for hire"
          owned by the greedy company, who owns the program?  That's right,
          the company.  But guess what?  In California  and  elsewhere  the
          company  just  became your employer!  This means that the company
          must now provide worker's compensation benefits for you AND UNEM-
          PLOYMENT INSURANCE.

          4.  A Brief Word About Licenses.

          4.1.  Why a license?

               When you get software  at  the  local  five  and  dime,  the
          manufacturer  claims  that you have a license to use that copy of
          the program.  The reason for this is that the manufacturer  wants
          to  place more restrictions on your use of the program than copy-
          right law places.  For example, licenses typically  say  you  can
          only  use the program on a single designated CPU.  Nothing in the
          copyright law says that.  Some licenses say you  cannot  make  an
          archive  copy.  The copyright law says you can, remember?  But if
          the license is a valid license, now you can't.  You can  sell  or
          give  away  your  copy  of  a program if you purchased it, right?
          That's permitted by copyright law, but the license  may  prohibit
          it.  The more restrictive terms of the license will apply instead
          of the more liberal copyright rules.

          4.2.  Is it valid?

               Is the license valid?  This is hotly debated among  lawyers.
          (What  isn't?   We'll argue about the time of day.)  A few states
          have passed or will soon pass laws declaring that they are valid.
          A  few  will  go the other way.  Federal legislation is unlikely.
          My argument is that at the consumer level,  the  license  is  not
          binding  because there is no true negotiation (unless a state law
          says it is binding), but hey that's just an argument and I'm  not
          saying  that  that's  the  law.   In any case, I think businesses
          which buy software will be treated differently in court than con-
          sumers.  Businesses should read those licenses and negotiate with
          the manufacturer if the terms are unacceptable.

          5.  I Have A Neat Idea. Can I Trademark It?  What About patent?

          5.1.  Trademark law explained

               Sorry, no luck.  Trademark law  protects  names:   names  of
          products  and  names of services.  (Note that I did not say names
          of companies.  Company names are not trademarkable.)  If you  buy
          a program that has a trademarked name, all that means is that you
          can't sell your own similar program under the same name.  It  has
          nothing to do with copying the program.

          5.2.  Patent Law

               Patent law can apply to computer  programs,  but  it  seldom
          does.   The  main  reasons  it seldom applies are practical:  the

9          patent process is too slow and too expensive to do much  good  in
          the software world.  There are also considerable legal hurdles to
          overcome in order to obtain a patent.  If, by chance,  a  program
          is  patented,  the  patent owner has the exclusive right to make,
          use or sell it for 17 years.

          6.  CONCLUSION

               I know this is a long article, but believe it or not I  just
          scratched  the  surface.  Hopefully, you'll find this information
          useful, and you'll stop passing along myths about copyright  law.

          on the first page.  Sorry, but I do not usually  have  access  to
          the network, so you can't reach me there.
