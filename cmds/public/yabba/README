yabbawhap - Y and AP compression filters

yabba applies Y compression to its input; unyabba decompresses the
result. whap applies AP compression to its input; unwhap decompresses
the result. whap and unwhap run at about the same speed as UNIX compress
and uncompress, which use LZW coding; yabba and unyabba are two to three
times slower. AP and Y compression are typically 10-20% more effective
than LZW compression in the same amount of memory. Y coding, unlike LZW
coding and AP coding, is unpatented. It should be possible to use these
programs on any reasonable C platform, though they were originally
designed on a BSD UNIX system.

2. Requirements

You should be able to adapt yabbawhap to practically any C platform
(with 8-bit characters). However, this package was designed on a UNIX
system. The compressors do not take file names; they only act as
filters. The support files are also oriented towards UNIX.

yabbawhap has been reported to work on the following systems:

Don't even bother with -finline-functions or the other function-call
optimizations.)

If your machine isn't in this list, and you get the programs working,
*please* send a note to me at brnstnd@nyu.edu on the Internet describing
what you had to do to make the programs compile. (Of course, please also
let me know if you have trouble, or if you have comments, questions, or
suggestions.) I'd rather be flooded with reports and be able to compile
a more comprehensive list than have no feedback because everyone assumes
someone else has talked to me first. You can use FORMLETTER if you want.
Thanks for being a good sport.



3. How to configure

First, run the sysconf shell script. It will try to figure out whether
you have bzero(), memset(), and a certain putchar() bug, and will modify
Makefile accordingly.

Next, make checkconf. Then run checkconf to see a few facts about your
current configuration. You can give it options, like -DNODEMAX=21000,
and it will instantly show you how that change will affect the size of
the programs if you add it to CCOPTS in the Makefile. It will also make
sure that various constraints are met. checkconf -H shows a help screen.

Next, read through the option descriptions in the Makefile, or print out
a copy and peruse it at your leisure. You can configure yabba, unyabba,
whap, and unwhap in several different ways to change compression size,
speed, and power. No single configuration is right for every job.

Finally, armed with checkconf and the option descriptions, decide how
you want to configure the programs. Change Makefile appropriately, and
remake checkconf just in case you want to experiment with changes later.

If you want to get through configuration as quickly as possible, run

  % ./sysconf

and press return when it asks whether it should make and run checkconf.
But don't complain to me about teething trouble if you haven't read
through all of README and Makefile, as well as the checkconf output.

Two big caveats: 1. ZEROFILLED should be off on practically any non-UNIX
operating system. 2. If you increase NODEMAX, you probably want to set
-DNODENUM=65533 unless you know your recipients have compiled with the
same high value of NODEMAX.



4. How to compile

Just make. You'll get yabba and unyabba. If your optimizer dies, first
try defining -DOPTCANT5 in the Makefile. If that doesn't work, try
-DOPTCANT2. If that doesn't work, try -DOPTCANT1, or lower the
optimization level.

To test the programs, run the ``try'' shell script with a filename
argument. % ./try yw.shar, for instance. try will give you times and
results for yabba, unyabba, compress, and uncompress on the file. (Note
that it does not test for nonexistent files or symbolic links.)

If you want to compile whap and unwhap, beware! AP coding is patented.
(Then again, LZW coding is patented, and people use compress all the
time.) You should understand the information in PATENTS first. Then if
you're curious to see how well AP coding can do, make AP. You can then
run the tryap and tryapy shell scripts the same way as try.

Another test you can run is to uudecode ycoding.uu and unyabba -m9999
the result, ycoding.Y. You should get a perfect copy of ycoding.4b.


5. How to install

By default, yabba and unyabba are installed in /usr/local/bin; whap and
unwhap are installed in /usr/local/bin; yabba.1 and unyabba.1 are
installed in /usr/man/man1. If you want to change these defaults, edit
INSTALL. Then run it from a root shell; it will check every action with
you before proceeding.


6. TODO list

-E errs
-f filterfile
  (Please don't bug me about having yabba take a filename argument
  until you've seen what -f does.)
-F
flexible -m? report size? (tnx dg)
make no-header and random-bits independent?
better RESET defaults?
put compression in function? will happen with -f
rename as fwhap, fyabba, funwhap, fyabba? no
use array trie for top level or two?
